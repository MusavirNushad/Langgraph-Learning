      "\n",
      "1. Hook & Premise  \n",
      "It’s 8:07 a.m. on a sweltering July morning in 2040. An autonomous electric rickshaw—painted in neon truck-art livery—glides past a rooftop bazaar where drones drop off solar-panel micro-inverters. An AI traffic cop hologram politely waves a delivery bot out of the BRT lane. A street kid sells NFTs of the city skyline from a QR-coded bracelet. The scene feels both familiar and alien.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Will Pakistan leapfrog into this kind of livable sci-fi, or will the same street be grid-locked by blackouts, water riots, and surveillance drones? The answer depends on how skillfully the country converts its three super-assets—youth, geography, and diaspora—into sustainable value over the next 16 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Executive Snapshot (TL;DR)  \n",
      "• Pakistan could add $1 trillion to global GDP by 2040 if it rides its demographic wave and climate-tech boom.  \n",
      "• Four divergent futures—Green Crescent, Silk Road Boomtown, Fortress Indus, Fragmented Futures—hinge on governance quality and social cohesion.  \n",
      "• Early signals in 2024-2027 (first NASDAQ unicorn IPO, mandatory climate-risk disclosure, TikTok “Digital Amnesty”) will tell us which path we’re on.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Infographic placeholder: Pakistan 2040 at a Glance – 245 m population, $1.8 T GDP, $50 B tech exports, Climate Risk Index 7.2]\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Methodology – How We Looked Ahead  \n",
      "We used the STEEP-V lens (Social, Technological, Economic, Environmental, Political, Values) and convened a Delphi panel of 30 Pakistani futurists, venture partners, climate scientists, and—yes—truck-art artists who read cultural tea leaves better than most economists. We then mapped scenarios along two axes: Governance Quality (low ↔ high) and Social Cohesion (fractured ↔ unified).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Megatrends Shaping Pakistan 2024-2040  \n",
      "4.1 Demographic Dividend on Steroids  \n",
      "By 2035, 150 million Pakistanis will be under 30. Urbanization will hit 55 %, birthing 15 new “million-cities.” The median age in Karachi will be 25; in Berlin, 47.  \n",
      "\n",
      "4.2 Climate Cascade  \n",
      "The Hindu Kush will lose one-third of its glacial volume by 2050. Heat domes topping 50 °C will push 10 million internal climate migrants toward the Indus corridor.  \n",
      "\n",
      "4.3 Geo-Economic Realignment  \n",
      "CPEC 2.0 pivots from roads to data centers. Gulf sovereign funds eye green hydrogen in Balochistan. BRICS+ membership gives Pakistan a seat at the new Bretton Woods.  \n",
      "\n",
      "4.4 Digital Leapfrogging  \n",
      "5G saturation arrives by 2028. Urdu large-language models power everything from madrassa chatbots to court transcription. Micro-entrepreneurs sell memes and merchandise to global Gen-Z audiences.  \n",
      "\n",
      "4.5 Values in Flux  \n",
      "“Sufi-Start-up” culture blends spiritual minimalism with hustle ethos. Gen-Z reclaims faith as open-source ethics. Women’s labor-force participation jumps from 22 % to 38 %, turbo-charging household incomes.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Four Plausible Scenarios to 2040  \n",
      "A. Green Crescent  \n",
      "Federal tech cities run on micro-grids. Agri-tech drones spray biochar over salt-stressed farms. Pakistan becomes the world’s fifth-largest seller of carbon credits, financing universal basic assets.  \n",
      "\n",
      "B. Silk Road Boomtown  \n",
      "Gwadar rivals Dubai for logistics throughput. Data-center corridor cools servers with chilled Arabian seawater. Yet Gini coefficients explode; gated “cloud enclaves” overlook sprawling migrant slums.  \n",
      "\n",
      "C. Fortress Indus  \n",
      "Security-first state funnels 8 % of GDP into surveillance. Internet is semi-closed; VPNs are the new currency. Remittances keep the lights on, but innovation stalls.  \n",
      "\n",
      "D. Fragmented Futures  \n",
      "Sub-regional fiefdoms issue their own stablecoins. Climate refugees create floating neighborhoods on the Indus. Crypto-governed enclaves experiment with quadratic voting and liquid democracy.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Deep-Dive Spotlights  \n",
      "6.1 Economy – From BPO to IPO  \n",
      "Pakistani SaaS firms, born out of 2020s freelance boom, hit $50 B in exports by 2040. Verticals: Islamic fintech compliance, climate-risk APIs, Urdu NLP engines. The first IPO on NASDAQ is a female-founded reg-tech unicorn.  \n",
      "\n",
      "6.2 Energy – 80 % Renewables  \n",
      "Micro-grids in Thar run on solar-plus-salt-battery storage. Indus hydro cascades feed green-hydrogen plants for export to Japan. Net-metering households sell surplus power back to the grid.  \n",
      "\n",
      "6.3 Education – AI Tutors Everywhere  \n",
      "Madrassas deploy AI tutors that teach coding via Quranic parables. Elite schools abandon A-Levels for nano-credentials stackable into global micro-masters. A 14-year-old from Muzaffargarh wins a Stanford scholarship with an AI-designed water-harvesting drone.  \n",
      "\n",
      "6.4 Health – Tele-Clinics on Motorbikes  \n",
      "CRISPR trials at Shifa International slash thalassemia rates by 70 %. Motorbike labs carry portable ultrasound and cloud-linked diagnostics to flood-hit villages. Average life expectancy rises to 74.  \n",
      "\n",
      "6.5 Culture – Esports Olympics Lahore  \n",
      "Punjabi-Korean fusion dramas top Netflix charts. Lahore hosts the 2038 Esports Olympics; Pakistan’s all-female Valorant team takes gold. Truck-art NFTs sell for six figures in Seoul galleries.  \n",
      "\n",
      "6.6 Gender – 30 % Female Unicorns  \n",
      "“She-EO” visas lure diaspora women back with fast-track citizenship and zero-capital-gains on startups. By 2040, 30 % of Pakistani unicorns have female founders.  \n",
      "\n",
      "6.7 Security – Drone Diplomacy  \n",
      "Border patrol uses AI drones that speak Pashto and Dari to de-escalate smuggler standoffs. Cyber-militias formed by ethical hackers neutralize ransomware cartels targeting hospitals.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Risks & Black Swans  \n",
      "• Kashmir flashpoint 2.0 triggers AI-generated sectarian deepfakes that go viral before fact-checkers wake up.  \n",
      "• A 7.8 quake in the Islamabad-Rawalpindi belt liquefies the Margalla foothills.  \n",
      "• IMF refuses a crypto-bailout after a scandal involving tokenized wheat subsidies.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. Early Signals to Watch (2024-2027)  \n",
      "• First Pakistani unicorn IPO on NASDAQ (ticker: PAKAI).  \n",
      "• PSX mandates climate-risk disclosure for all listed firms.  \n",
      "• TikTok ban reversed via “Digital Amnesty” that taxes creators instead of censoring them.  \n",
      "• 3D-printed mosque in Gwadar uses desert-sand geopolymer.\n",
